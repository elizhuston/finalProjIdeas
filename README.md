# finalProjIdeas

1) A Family Social Networking/Archive site that would allow users to create a private group, closed to all except family members and provide a private forum 
   to share news, history, photos, videos and recipes with one another.  Sort of a combination of Nextdoor, Facebook, and All Recipes.
    
    MVP and Technology used for the project will be selected/determined by the team doing the work.  Obviously, we'll need at least a web server, a database, and application security.  
    
    User Stories/Backlog - 
    
    - A user would be able to create their own account
    - A user would be able to login to their account
    - A user would be able to add other family members to their family
    - A user would be able to designate other family members as administrators
    - As a family administrator, I need to be certain only administrators can add new family members
    - As a user I need to be able to upload family photos for members of my family
    - As a user I need to be able to add recipes to our family recipe box
    - As a user I need to be able to write family history information, include news articles, etc...
    - As a user I need to be able to view and print recipes from our family recipe box
    - As a user I need to be able to post general news/feed comments for family members
    - As a user I would like to be able to view family tree data
    - As a user I would like to be able to organize family photos into "albums", to make them easier to find in the future.
    - As a user, I would like to be able to view and maintain family birth, marriage, death and burial records
    - As a user, I would like to have the capability to invite family members to reunions or other family events
